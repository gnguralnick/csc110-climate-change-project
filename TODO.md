## Programming

### Importing Data

- [x] `land-ocean_temperature_index.csv`
    - All columns
    - Import as a dict of TemperatureData and as a DataFrame.
- [ ] `regional-snowfall-index_c20170317.csv`
    - Region
    - Start
    - End
    - RSI
    - Category
    - Pandas maybe, if it works for us, otherwise something with dataclasses.

### Visualization

- [ ] Figure out how to use https://plotly.com/python/mapbox-density-heatmaps/
    - We want to go through the years showing snowfall RSI, with a heat bar/value on the side.
- [ ] Line graph of average totals over time, if we have time after.
